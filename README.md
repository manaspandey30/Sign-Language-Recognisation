# 🌟 Sign Language Recognition using Deep Learning

## **Overview**
Sign language is a crucial means of communication for individuals with hearing and speech impairments. This project aims to bridge the communication gap by developing an **AI-powered Sign Language Recognition System** using deep learning and computer vision. The model accurately identifies and translates sign language gestures into text or speech, enabling seamless interaction between sign language users and non-signers.

## **Key Features**
✅ **Real-time Sign Detection** – Detects and translates sign language gestures in real-time.
✅ **Deep Learning Powered** – Utilizes CNNs (Convolutional Neural Networks) for accurate recognition.
✅ **Multi-Language Support** – Can be extended to recognize different sign languages (ASL, ISL, BSL, etc.).
✅ **User-Friendly Interface** – Interactive GUI for accessibility and ease of use.
✅ **Open-Source & Expandable** – Designed for scalability with future enhancements.

## **Tech Stack**
- **Programming Language:** Python 🐍
- **Deep Learning Framework:** TensorFlow/Keras
- **Computer Vision:** OpenCV
- **Dataset:** Publicly available sign language datasets or custom dataset creation.
- **Frontend:** Streamlit / Flask for user interface.
- **Hardware:** WebCam / External Camera for gesture capture.

## **Project Workflow**
1. **Data Collection** – Gather sign language images/videos from available datasets.
2. **Preprocessing** – Resize, normalize, and augment data for better model performance.
3. **Model Training** – Train a CNN-based model using TensorFlow/Keras.
4. **Real-time Recognition** – Deploy the trained model to detect and translate gestures.
5. **GUI Integration** – Build an interactive interface for real-world usability.

## **Installation & Setup**
1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sign-language-recognition.git
   cd sign-language-recognition
   ```
2. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. **Run the Application:**
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

## **Dataset Used**
We use the **American Sign Language (ASL) dataset** and **self-collected gesture images**. You can also fine-tune the model with custom datasets for enhanced accuracy.

## **Model Architecture**
- **Input Layer:** Preprocessed sign language images
- **Convolutional Layers:** Extract spatial features
- **Pooling Layers:** Reduce dimensionality
- **Fully Connected Layers:** Classify gestures
- **Output Layer:** Softmax for sign prediction

## **Future Enhancements**
🚀 **Voice Output Integration** – Convert recognized signs into speech for better communication.
🚀 **Support for Multiple Sign Languages** – Expand beyond ASL to global sign languages.
🚀 **Mobile & Web Deployment** – Extend the system to mobile applications.
